[00:28] [0mGlowie flaps : as a business owner - whats the point of unionizing?[0m
[00:28] [0mAdalius flaps : None. You usually only do it if the employees insist (which means they file[0m
[00:28] [0m                paperwork and force a unionization vote)[0m
[00:29] [0mAdalius flaps : It ends up costing you more money (pay and benes) plus you have to pay the union[0m
