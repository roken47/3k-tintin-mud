[22:26] [0m                     is why I was pointing you to the 'follow' command, since that will make it[0m

[22:26] [0m[35;1mDub [Jedi(51)]:[0m I tried summon, it said I didn't have a droid[0m
[22:26] [0m[35;1mBaywatch [Jedi(17)]:[0m that sounds like a bug to me[0m
[22:27] [0m[35;1mBaywatch [Jedi(17)]:[0m you cant just lose it if it cant follow yoiu[0m
[22:27] [0m[35;1mBaywatch [Jedi(17)]:[0m you go back and its gone?[0m
[22:27] [0m[35;1mAdalius [Jedi(WGM)]:[0m Its not a bug. If its in a room that unloads, the droid gets dested, poof,[0m
[22:27] [0m                     gone, bye bye.[0m
[22:27] [0m[35;1mDub [Jedi(51)]:[0m it's gone! :) as adalius pointed out, it probably was destroyed in a room unload[0m
[22:27] [0m[35;1mDub [Jedi(51)]:[0m so if you dismiss it, it goes away but can be respawned?[0m
[22:28] [0m[35;1mBaywatch [Jedi(17)]:[0m ok, what is a room unload? like reboot?[0m
[22:28] [0m[35;1mAdalius [Jedi(WGM)]:[0m Nope. There is no respawning of droids period. If you make the actual[0m
