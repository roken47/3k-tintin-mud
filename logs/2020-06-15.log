[00:43] [0m[37;1mXiu flaps :[0m the main issue power-wise is that regen doesn't scale. costs end up scaling because[0m

[00:46] [0m[37;1mXiu flaps :[0m well one issue is that there's a hard cap on how much you can gain from regen runes.[0m
[00:46] [0m            no matter your skills or how many runes you have it's capped. because when the guild[0m

[00:46] [0m[37;1mRasputin flaps :[0m kinda like necro np regen. it's still at the old lvl even tho they got a ton[0m
[00:46] [0m                 more np now. so if you run out and let it naturally regen you're sitting still[0m

[00:46] [0m[37;1mXiu flaps :[0m we don't get much from corpses. a token amount of GP. we don't want to go that route[0m

[00:49] [0m            simple # tweaking just set them to 256 or something un-attainable anyway. next, add[0m
[00:49] [0m            an additional GP2 pool which has a huge max. have that charge somewhat by killing[0m
[00:49] [0m            stuff. NOT based on corpse, just the kill. so no hoarding above the new pool max.[0m

[00:50] [0m[37;1mXiu flaps :[0m that gives a bit more baseline regen (while actually rewarding rune skills which atm[0m
