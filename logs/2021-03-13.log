[01:16] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: so im just checking this game out :) i was wondering if you could help[0m

[01:16] [0mnewb Din [bladesinger/133]: shoot[0m
[01:16] [0mnewb Ser [psicorps/137]: dont shoot[0m
[01:17] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: so....saw that the game has a crazy set of guilds, and i assume[0m
[01:17] [0m                        playstyles, which is awesome[0m
[01:17] [0mnewb Alassra [necromancer/136]: think of guilds like classes, yeah[0m
[01:17] [0mnewb Din [bladesinger/133]: yeah, guilds are like classes but more diverse[0m
[01:17] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: my question is, i typically play a few archetypes in games, i like the[0m
[01:17] [0m                        berserker class, aggressive warriors that are all offense, no defense,[0m
[01:17] [0m                        typically lots of health costs, etc[0m
[01:18] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: and i also like playing the assassin classes, ninjas, rogues, that hide[0m
[01:18] [0m                        in shadows and backstab, etc[0m
[01:18] [0mnewb Ser [psicorps/137]: whats your opinion on bards[0m
[01:18] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: just because there's no "berserker" and "assassin" guilds, what guilds[0m
[01:18] [0m                        offer those playstyles?[0m
[01:18] [0mnewb Din [bladesinger/133]: we don't have the latter, thankfully, but we kinda have the former[0m
[01:18] [0mnewb Sissy [knight/59]: guilds have subguilds for more variety ... say dark-dmg jedi vs light[0m
[01:18] [0m                        ... different suits for juggernaut from uber tank to massive damage, etc[0m
[01:18] [0mnewb Alassra [necromancer/136]: Fremen might be sneaky/assassiny?[0m
[01:18] [0mnewb Din [bladesinger/133]: in effect.  elementals have a lot of hps and hit very hard[0m
[01:18] [0mnewb Prism [gentech/135]: There really is no such thing as a dark jedi atm tho[0m
[01:19] [0mnewb Ser [psicorps/137]: fremen arent really up to todays standards tho[0m
[01:19] [0mnewb Alassra [necromancer/136]: Knights have some forms (focus?) that are more offense focused[0m
[01:19] [0mnewb Stasis [elemental/135]: knights get pretty savage in offesive/focus[0m
[01:19] [0mnewb Sissy [knight/59]: necros and elemental hit pretty hard[0m
[01:20] [0mnewb Kirin [knight/121]: fremen and bards both technically have a hide+ambush mechanic, neither[0m
[01:20] [0m                         particularly ends up depending on it/it won't kill any mob of note[0m
[01:20] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: gotcha, so basically there's no exact berserker or assassin style[0m
[01:20] [0m                        classes, but lots of guilds can sort of replicate that playstyle[0m

[01:21] [0m                        the playstyle[0m

[01:22] [0mnewb Skyblade [knight/60]: I just recently lamented the lack of a rogue class.[0m
[01:23] [0mnewb Melly [elemental/136]: fremen are rogues kinda![0m
[01:23] [0mnewb Skyblade [knight/60]: I was surprised they went with Android for a core choice.[0m
[01:23] [0mnewb Kirin [knight/121]: they're about the closest you'd get to that design here, yeah (fremen[0m
[01:23] [0m                         that is)[0m
[01:23] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: are new guilds still being developed?[0m
[01:23] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: gotcha, i think that can still capture the berserker playstyle[0m
[01:24] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: what i am honestly shocked by is how many players are on this game[0m
[01:24] [0mnewb Din [bladesinger/133]: yep, in fact there's a viking guild in the works.  could be that[0m
[01:24] [0m                            fits the berserker style you're looking for.  we don't know yet, the[0m

[01:26] [0mnewb Kirin [knight/121]: but back to the question, guilds are a bit more encompassing than what[0m
[01:26] [0m                         would normally be a class, generally, and as said some guilds have[0m
[01:26] [0m                         subguilds that can be quite different in style[0m

[01:27] [0mnewb Din [bladesinger/133]: there's also monks, though they're a bit behind the curve atm.  if[0m
[01:27] [0m                            you're into assassins you might sidestep a bit and enjoy punching[0m

[01:29] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: so my other question is, why is there a 3kingdoms and a 3scapes? that is[0m
[01:29] [0m                        a little confusing[0m

[01:30] [0m                            there.  3s has kinda had a rocky go of it, but it's still active. [0m
[01:30] [0m                            far less so than 3k[0m
[01:30] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: how is the ruleset different?[0m
[01:30] [0mnewb Skyblade [knight/60]: I've never felt the need to ever go to 3s, so much here.[0m
[01:31] [0mnewb Melly [elemental/136]: you can unlock unlimited alts instead of a cap of 4+1 hardcore,[0m
[01:31] [0m                            qinfo and botting are both illegal there. progress is generally[0m
[01:31] [0m                            faster, but top end is more limited[0m
[01:31] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: interesting[0m

[01:32] [0mnewb Din [bladesinger/133]: but 3k has had much more active development and has put in a ton of[0m
[01:32] [0m                            cool new stuff compared to 3s[0m
[01:32] [0mnewb Gigantor [Newbie]: okay well, i do have to go now but i will most likely make a character[0m
[01:32] [0m                        and try this out :) most likely on 3k. thanks for all the help everybody[0m
