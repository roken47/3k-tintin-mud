[23:11] [0mInix flaps : Interesting...[0m
[23:11] [0mInix flaps : They should have thought for another name, then.[0m
[23:11] [0mXaranthia flaps : it fits if you understand that lich means corpse[0m

[23:13] [0mInix flaps : I'm saying the name is not appropriate[0m
[23:13] [0mInix flaps : and a simple google of 'demilich' agrees[0m
[23:13] [0mInix flaps : as the first line that comes up is "Despite the name.."[0m
[23:14] [0mXaranthia flaps : that isn't true Fluffy[0m
[23:14] [0mXiu flaps : i remember the old d&d demilich that was described as like just[0m
