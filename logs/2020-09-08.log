[09:24] [0m[32mYou tell Toren:[0m oh the coincidence, our class had an activity for flexbox froggy. I was on vacation in colorado during class... er need I say more?[0m
[09:25] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m So, attribute text/js tells the browser what type of file is being loaded[0m
[09:26] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m Browsers in the past would try to guess what type of code was being loaded[0m
[09:26] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m But, that's going away if it hasn't completely already - since it's unsafe[0m
[09:27] [0m[32mYou tell Toren:[0m ok was curious why that js script was embeded in html versus linking it like the other script elements[0m
[09:27] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m And by loading different files, I can seperate code more.  So there is javascript that is just used for the landing page, javascript that is just for a carousel, etc.  And I load that file where I want it instead of having one huge file full of all my javascript[0m
[09:28] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m Oh, the direct script.  If it's like 4 lines of code only relevant for that page, I'll just write it in-line usually.[0m
[09:28] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m I could put it in a separate file if I really wanted to - but didn't bother.[0m
[09:29] [0m[32mYou tell Toren:[0m ohh alright! And that is considered unsafe, but understandable why you wouldn't tuck away a few lines in a separate file[0m
[09:29] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m It's no less 'unsafe' than having it in a file[0m
[09:29] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m At the end of the day it's all compiled[0m
[09:29] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m It's just more maintainable in general if it's in separate files.[0m
[09:30] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m the <script src="blah"> is equivalent to writing that javascript the way I did it there.[0m
[09:31] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m Just, one is modular and a better practice for larger projects.[0m
[09:31] [0m[32mYou tell Toren:[0m how are the standard changing for it be safe?[0m
[09:31] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m I'm not sure I understand what you're asking.  What makes you think it's unsafe?[0m
[09:34] [0m[32mYou tell Toren:[0m thought of your 'unsafe' claim. Is there going to be a change to encrypt js from public view?[0m
[09:35] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m Oh.  The 'unsafe' was based on that you used to just be able to do <script src="blah"> and not decalre what type of file it is.  So the browser would try to guess if it was js, css, etc.  And now you have to declare what type of file it is.[0m
[09:36] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m You can't encrypt the javascript file because then the browser can't read it[0m
[09:36] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m And also, users have a right to know what code you're executing on their computer.[0m
[09:36] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m For the most part that's the general mindset of the web.[0m
[09:37] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m You can uglify / mutilate javascript which makes it so you can't view source and steal code[0m
[09:37] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m You could still copy and paste it, but you'll have nfi what variables are doing what or what functions are doing what[0m
[09:38] [0m[32mYou tell Toren:[0m in other words make it hard to read? ahhah alright[0m
[09:57] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m Well, minifying reduces the size of the script file as well[0m
[09:57] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m So, you do always want to minify production code[0m
[09:58] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m For example, if you have function function1 {const somevar} it'll make it function a {const b}[0m
[09:59] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m And strip out all white space/etc to cut down on file size[0m
[09:59] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m But yes - the idea is to make it hard to read by uglify/mutilating/mangling[0m
[09:59] [0m[32mToren tells you:[0m uglify and minify are the same thing btw.  uglify is just a well known minifying library[0m
