[08:40] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m yeah well i was gunna try to sort that out, lemme think out loud[0m
[08:41] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m my observation was that the droids seemed to proc more at higher tiers[0m
[08:42] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m which meant that they leveled faster, and also no one knew anything so[0m
[08:42] [0m                  everyone was just kinda doing their own thing. old west style[0m
[08:42] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m so i just kinda focused on one droid type which was security[0m
[08:43] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m i think at tier 3 there wasnt one, so i had to switch fo something else which[0m
[08:43] [0m                  i think was military until i found the robodog[0m
[08:44] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m so in this i started to figure out what a good leveling path for droids would[0m
[08:44] [0m                  have looked like, but it still didnt really matter because the robo levels[0m
[08:44] [0m                  were going pretty fast proportional to droid levels[0m
[08:44] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m after i hit robo 4 tho, addy tweaked some stuff, and basically to hit robo 5[0m
[08:44] [0m                  you need somewhere around 100 droid mastery levels[0m
[08:45] [0m[35;1mEnder [Jedi(Knight)]:[0m that seems like a lot.[0m
[08:45] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m so the landscape of the grind starts to change a lot at tier 4[0m
[08:45] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m and you start looking at all kinds of droid types to train[0m
[08:45] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m but... in my testing the tier 4 droids for the most part still train faster[0m
[08:45] [0m                  than the other ones[0m
[08:46] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m with some notable exceptions[0m
[08:46] [0m[35;1mEnder [Jedi(Knight)]:[0m I guess though, if you need lots of droid levels, a tier 1 droid at level[0m
[08:46] [0m                      1 will be faster than a tier 4 droid at a higher level...[0m
[08:47] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m so to bring this back around... while you are sitting in your tier 4 grind...[0m
[08:47] [0m                  you actually have a pretty good droid selection[0m
[08:47] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m but one of the prime droids for speed at tier 4 is security[0m
[08:47] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m which i had already basically maxed out[0m
[08:48] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m so i lost out on a ton of leveling efficiency in the most crucial stage[0m
[08:48] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(98)]:[0m that droid also has a very nice heal[0m
