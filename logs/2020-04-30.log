[19:12] [0m           effected by the wearer. thus, the protection runes cannot add[0m
[19:12] [0m           much AC in the long run because a newbie Blade with my runes gets[0m
[19:12] [0m           the same effect as I do out of them. if I was getting "a lot"[0m
[19:12] [0m           then a newbie Blade with mine could tank crysmal.[0m
