[09:59] [0m               alright with everyone?[0m
[10:00] [0mFei [Jedi(8)]: How do I...actually get a lightsaber and be able to use it?[0m
[10:00] [0mSaim [Jedi(Master)]: thats what this line is for, and chaed's recipes[0m
[10:00] [0mFei [Jedi(8)]: I sincerely hope Chaed's recipes don't all involve clenching[0m
[10:00] [0m               tight and not farting.[0m
[10:00] [0mSaim [Jedi(Master)]: no, but they typically involve ephedrine[0m

[11:11] [0m               and others aren't.  I thought something like Meditation would[0m
[11:11] [0m               be pretty rudimentary.[0m

[11:12] [0m               obviously important.[0m

[11:13] [0mFei [Jedi(8)]: Yeah, I've read that file three times so far and don't really[0m
[11:13] [0m               understand it at all.[0m
[11:13] [0mMugen [Jedi(Knight)]: you can then use that + info <skill> to see what force[0m
[11:13] [0m                      skills affect it[0m
[11:13] [0mBurnaby [Jedi(47)]: it is a little confusing. especially at first[0m
[11:13] [0mMugen [Jedi(Knight)]: like lightsaber combat, is giverned by sense and[0m

[11:13] [0m               hidden prerequisite?"[0m
[11:13] [0mMugen [Jedi(Knight)]: so if you want to unlock that, raise those 2[0m
[11:13] [0mHyuga [Jedi(88)]: skill difficulty[0m
[11:14] [0mBurnaby [Jedi(47)]: focus on conc, force, dodge, ls combat, lfs, ri when you[0m
[11:14] [0m                    can, gfs when you can, asborb and dissipate energy are[0m
[11:14] [0m                    useful, htrance for force, meditation for conc.[0m
[11:14] [0mGunman [Jedi(67)]: also look at your career. it makes certain things more[0m
[11:14] [0m                   and less difficult to learn[0m
[11:14] [0mFei [Jedi(8)]: Sure.  But it's a word not a number on skill difficulty.[0m
[11:14] [0mHyuga [Jedi(88)]: info skill difficulty[0m
[11:14] [0mHyuga [Jedi(88)]: there are numbers[0m
[11:14] [0mMugen [Jedi(Knight)]: so 'info skill difficulty' translates them to numbers[0m
[11:15] [0mFei [Jedi(8)]: Ah, I think that's what I've been missing.[0m
[11:15] [0mHyuga [Jedi(88)]: it is a little confusing at first.  can give some examples[0m
[11:15] [0m                  if that helps[0m
[11:16] [0mFei [Jedi(8)]: So, a Moderate requires a five.  That's kind of interesting.[0m

[11:16] [0m               stats?[0m
[11:17] [0mFei [Jedi(8)]: I was talking about Meditation because I thought it would be[0m
[11:17] [0m               good to have a recovery ability after long combats.[0m
[11:17] [0mFei [Jedi(8)]: I was noticing how low my Concentration was getting after[0m

[11:18] [0mFei [Jedi(8)]: Yes, Ukyo was helping me last night.[0m
[11:18] [0mChaed [Jedi(AGM)]: your conc shouldn't dip that bad when you fight solo[0m
[11:19] [0mChaed [Jedi(AGM)]: but yeah, med relies on sense and control[0m
[11:19] [0mChaed [Jedi(AGM)]: with a rating of M, it means you need an average of 5[0m
[11:19] [0m                   from both before med unlocks[0m
[11:19] [0mFei [Jedi(8)]: So, how do you know when you can train the next guild stat?[0m
[11:19] [0mBurnaby [Jedi(47)]: you train one of either Force, Alter or Sense each[0m
