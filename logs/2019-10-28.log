[00:40] [0m            it would be simplier for dungeons - just "dungeons clear"?[0m

[00:43] [0m            it is easy enough to doublecheck by using the dungeons command.[0m
[00:44] [0mXiu flaps : thing is it won't even show up. "dungeons" when you aren't saved to X dungeon does[0m
[00:44] [0m            not display that dungeon at all, let alone the fact that you're saved to it. then[0m

[00:44] [0m            and without ever knowing you were even in a party in my case[0m
[00:44] [0mSky flaps : if you set the scaler and are the first to enter that dungeon of the party members,[0m
[00:44] [0m            its your dungeons -- just "shared" with others[0m
[00:45] [0mXiu flaps : yeah so if the person who rallied me already used theirs, i end up in theirs.[0m
[00:45] [0mSky flaps : in that case it would show up on your dungeons[0m
[00:46] [0mSky flaps :  oh no.. you're right - it wouldnt, until you entered[0m
