[19:50] [0m<BS> Fennec : what wc should i be aiming for?[0m
[19:50] [0m<BS> Din : the confusing reality of lodges and rejuvenate is that rejuv is[0m

[19:50] [0m<BS> Dangerzone : spirit sword 15+?[0m
[19:50] [0m<BS> Xiu : while wc is part of the formula i don't worry much about it[0m

[19:51] [0m<BS> Fennec : you're bring'n me down, din.[0m
[19:51] [0m<BS> Din : it matters a little, enough to be noticeable when you're low[0m

[19:51] [0m<BS> Lachlan : so both.. wc and the fun factor.[0m
[19:51] [0m<BS> Xiu : partly because our dmg isn't heavily based on it but mainly[0m
[19:51] [0m           because even at lowest possible dmg setup your issue will always[0m
[19:51] [0m           and forever be wanting to tank better. never dmg.[0m

[19:52] [0m<BS> Xiu : that's the kind of thing i'm not allowed to use because video[0m
[19:52] [0m           games like this will turn me into a bad person[0m
[19:52] [0m<BS> Din : yeah, there really isn't a period in bladesingers (at least at[0m

[19:54] [0m               very little fight management. That gets better at the top[0m
