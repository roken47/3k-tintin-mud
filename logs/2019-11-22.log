[03:11] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(94)]:[0m shimura are very expensive at early glvls[0m

[03:11] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(94)]:[0m or just grind thru it[0m
[03:12] [0m[35;1mGraey [Jedi(14)]:[0m it wasn't even ki burst that was the only problem. i didn't even dare use that[0m
[03:12] [0m                  because it made things so much worse but even without it all conc was gone way[0m
[03:12] [0m                  too fast[0m
[03:13] [0m[35;1mGraey [Jedi(14)]:[0m jedi seem to have what i think of as the "fremen pain problem" where you train[0m
[03:13] [0m                  something and it gets more effective, yes but it also gets more expensive to[0m
[03:13] [0m                  use. which can actually mean it's objectively worse because while it'd be[0m
[03:13] [0m                  great to do more of <the thing it does> if you can't afford to use it anymore[0m
[03:13] [0m                  you get 0 of <thing it does>. and with no way to dial back.[0m
[03:15] [0m[35;1mGraey [Jedi(14)]:[0m so my deal with ki burst itself was probably worse than it needed to be[0m
[03:15] [0m                  because i stupidly trained it to 5/5 right away. thinking that it'd be good to[0m
[03:15] [0m                  be better at it. turns out it was probably a terrible idea. altho of course[0m
[03:15] [0m                  even without it i couldn't hang in combat so it was kinda moot[0m
[03:19] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(94)]:[0m that used to be the case in jedi and still is in the esrly mid glvls but with[0m
[03:19] [0m                  the new gxp rates and such conc/force eventually fixes itself[0m

[03:27] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(94)]:[0m so you raise control/sense/alter/control in that order[0m
[03:28] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(94)]:[0m also if you want you can swap sense in first later when conc costs go jp[0m
[03:28] [0m[35;1mGraey [Jedi(14)]:[0m keeping all 3 equal, even if you don't "need" alter?[0m
[03:28] [0m[35;1mHyuga [Jedi(94)]:[0m but initally you wanna do control first because it unlocks new tiers of skills[0m
