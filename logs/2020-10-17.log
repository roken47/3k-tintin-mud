[23:20] [0mHavox {Professions}: success :) thanks Byron for suggesting[0m
[23:20] [0mSimonz {Professions}: yeah, so it's a flag when you wear that doesn't get cleared properly[0m
[23:24] [0mHavox {Professions}: ok this problem come back when i unwield and try to wield again[0m
[23:25] [0mTurak {Professions}: that tracks if it's not clearing the flag, wear item +1 to set, remove item[0m
[23:25] [0m                     nothing.. wear item (hey, your set is already full)[0m
[23:26] [0mTurak {Professions}: which is..not ideal[0m
[23:26] [0mSpace {Professions}: specially because some folks were planing on xmuting multiple cmcs through[0m
[23:26] [0m                     the boot[0m
[23:27] [0mSpace {Professions}: this seems like whatever you xmute and were you keep that till end of boot,[0m
[23:27] [0m                     like turak said not ideal[0m
[23:28] [0mHavox {Professions}: but i did not wear cocoon i transmute for you, so this makes even less[0m
[23:28] [0m                     sense to me[0m
[23:28] [0mTurak {Professions}: yeah basically means any time you remove a transmuted item you need to[0m
[23:28] [0m                     relog to purge the flag.[0m
[23:28] [0mTurak {Professions}: dont think it has anything to do with anything you gave away[0m
[23:32] [0mSpace {Professions}: thin if i were to dispose the cocoon he xmuted for me that might solve the[0m
[23:32] [0m                     issue?[0m

[23:33] [0mByron {Professions}: so...can someone else wear that cocoon?[0m
[23:33] [0mAsp {Professions}: just can't wield and unwield the xmuted weapon until fixed[0m
[23:33] [0mAsp {Professions}: i assume[0m
[23:34] [0mVoodoo {Professions}: wounds like the pants factor has not been considered[0m
[23:35] [0mAsp {Professions}: might be pants-code related, once you remove pants you can never wear them[0m
[23:35] [0m                   again[0m
[23:36] [0mSpace {Professions}: ok so working theory is if you wear/wield it sets some flag, and then[0m
[23:36] [0m                     remove/unwield doesnt clear it, has anyone tested this? i.e they have only[0m

[23:37] [0mTurak {Professions}: and it has to be an item from after the changes, obviously, hehe.[0m
[23:37] [0mTurak {Professions}: beforetimes items dont interact with the system at all[0m
