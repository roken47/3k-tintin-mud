[13:46] [0mKillergate [86]: but my 21 int needs attention[0m
[13:47] [0mTony [88]: so take it with a grain of salt as I was around when stats didn't really matter a whole lot... we recently got a rework on how our damage scaling works and my memory could be totally off[0m
[13:47] [0mTony [88]: GASP!  I thought I had the worst int in bards[0m
[13:47] [0mnewb Ande [Newbie]: is there a setting so that I won't have to type MORE if the output is super long?[0m
[13:47] [0mTony [88]: heh, i got 50 right now[0m
[13:48] [0mTony [88]: (working on fixing it obviously)[0m
[13:48] [0mnewb Gumby [cyborg/102]: no you have to hit enter to see more than one page of text[0m
[13:48] [0mnewb Gaidin [gentech/133]: help setmod[0m
[13:48] [0mnewb Ziphe [priest/136]: yeah you don't have to type MORE, just press enter[0m
[13:48] [0mTony [88]: like i said, when i was playing stats didn't really matter a whole lot    now they do[0m
[13:48] [0mnewb Ziphe [priest/136]: yeah you don't have to type MORE, just press enter[0m
[13:50] [0mnewb Fennec [bladesinger/59]: so yes, all you have to do is hit enter. but with Gaidin's suggestion of changing your setmod, you might not have to unless it's a super long info file or something.[0m
[13:51] [0mnewb Fennec [bladesinger/59]: the problem if you change your setmod too high is that the top of it will scroll off your screen before you can read it. so it could either be an issue of hitting enter to go to the next page or manually scrolling up the screen.[0m
[13:52] [0mnewb Toren [necromancer/117]: personally I'd rather have it scroll off and use page up/down for one complete wall of text[0m
[13:52] [0mnewb Terran [gentech/111]: I prefer to use the screen lock on my side vs pressing enter to read stuff, especially if i have a script active[0m
[13:54] [0mnewb Ande [Newbie]: thanks so much. I have a MUD capture plugg-in which captures output, so that isn't a problem.[0m
[13:55] [0mnewb Gumby [cyborg/102]: noiiiice[0m
[13:56] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/18]: portal is giving me the business. CAn someone point me in the direction of a client that is simple to set up so I can STOP using telnet[0m
[13:56] [0mnewb Gaidin [gentech/133]: Mudlet[0m
[13:56] [0mnewb Ande [Newbie]: MusshClient Portable[0m
[13:56] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/18]: is that for phoines?[0m
[13:57] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/18]: phones* . I've been using Blowtorch for my mobile device[0m
[13:57] [0mnewb Ande [Newbie]: no, MusshClient is for PC[0m
[13:58] [0mnewb Gaidin [gentech/133]: It's steep learning curve, but for phone the best option is to set up tintin on a remote server.  SSH clients work far better on phones than MUD clients do.[0m
[13:58] [0mnewb Fennec [bladesinger/59]: lol! i didn't suggest that one because i didn't think that was easy to setup. but i prefer that one.[0m
[13:58] [0mnewb Hsima [sii/132]: is takamori still maintaining amud[0m
[13:59] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/18]: I only use my phone for those fights that take FOREVER. i USED TO RUN TINTIN, BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO. i JUST WANNA GET OFF TELNET FIRST. HA[0m
[13:59] [0mnewb Fennec [bladesinger/59]: i wanna say no, but i'm not certain. i think it's still available, but maybe not updated.[0m
[13:59] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/18]: sorry for all caps. Telnet.[0m
[13:59] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/18]: I looked for amud in the play store, no luck[0m
[14:00] [0mnewb Hsima [sii/132]: then all the clients are more or less the same learning curve wise[0m
[14:00] [0mnewb Hsima [sii/132]: amud was the only one that was 3k out of the box[0m
[14:00] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/18]: i liked it[0m
[14:00] [0mnewb Drax [cyborg/111]: I think you can still get amud on the amazon app store[0m
[14:01] [0mnewb Ande [Newbie]: and yet another question. Short of putting hitpoints into my prompt, is there a command that will give me only HP?[0m
[14:01] [0mnewb Hsima [sii/132]: I have a cleric plugin for mudlet if that helps :D[0m
[14:02] [0mnewb Gumby [cyborg/102]: i dont think adventure can configure hp bar ... most gobjs give you that options[0m
[14:03] [0mnewb Whoknows [priest/133]: type hp, do u get an output?[0m
[14:03] [0mnewb Whoknows [priest/133]: if so, do autohp, if that doesnt work, forcehp[0m
[14:03] [0mnewb Ande [Newbie]: why yes I do! Thanks so much.[0m

[16:32] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/22]: are there any actual mechanics to carry weight other than not being able to carry stuff.[0m
[16:32] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/22]: in other words, does being over burdened or something affect your str damage?[0m
[16:32] [0mnewb Terran [gentech/111]: yeah...your "Defense" suffers under 'sc'[0m
[16:32] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/22]: thank you.[0m
[16:32] [0mnewb Terran [gentech/111]: Defense also known as SMD or Special Melee Defense[0m
[16:33] [0mnewb Fennec [bladesinger/59]: oh! i learned something new. thanks, terran![0m
[16:33] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/22]: gotta beef up that str stat then.[0m
[16:33] [0mnewb Terran [gentech/111]: You can get reforgers, profwho reforger, to reforge gear and move AC from categories into Defense if you don't need the AC from those categories. Helps increase SMD which helps you tank better overall[0m
[16:34] [0mnewb Hsima [sii/132]: that really only is a large effect if you're huge or in certain guilds though.  Most smaller players are just at "none" for smd so can't get any worse.[0m
[16:34] [0mnewb Terran [gentech/111]: Smaller players can still get reforged stuff or RoHs, etc etc...if provided to them. It is still relevant to planning stats for future[0m

[17:31] [0mnewb Gaidin [gentech/133]: That's it in Androids[0m
[17:31] [0mnewb Kent [android/36]: IIRC I saw 100 glvls[0m
[17:32] [0mnewb Gaidin [gentech/133]: 100 levels[0m
[17:32] [0mnewb Jeraud [android/61]: It's level 100, glvl 60.[0m
[17:32] [0mnewb Kent [android/36]: mud lvl?[0m
[17:32] [0mnewb Jeraud [android/61]: Yup.[0m
[17:32] [0mnewb Gaidin [gentech/133]: Core guilds are limited to mud level 100.  Android max at guild level 60.[0m
[17:32] [0mnewb Kent [android/36]: oh wasted a HC on this? laf[0m
[17:33] [0mnewb Gaidin [gentech/133]: Most people put HCs in Androids.  They level up fast, are pretty tough, and can get to 100 pretty quickly.[0m
[17:33] [0mnewb Vidae [bard/70]: That's my plan[0m
[17:33] [0mnewb Whoknows [priest/133]: weak[0m
[17:33] [0mnewb Jeraud [android/61]: With the right setup can kill some big monsters.[0m
[17:33] [0mnewb Kent [android/36]: no potential for higher mskills tho[0m
[17:34] [0mnewb Whoknows [priest/133]: isn't it max benefit at 100?[0m
[17:34] [0mnewb Kent [android/36]: whatever I'll take it[0m
[17:34] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/23]: HC?[0m
[17:34] [0mnewb Jeraud [android/61]: Hardcore.[0m
[17:34] [0mnewb Meatstax [cleric/23]: thanks[0m
[17:34] [0mnewb Jeraud [android/61]: Meaning if you die even once, you're done with that character.[0m
[17:34] [0mnewb Gaidin [gentech/133]: The time investment past 100 gets pretty heavy anyways just for a mskill point every 5 levels.[0m
[17:37] [0mnewb Kent [android/36]: nothing says there is a limit in 'help hardcore' <30 at every 5 levels[0m
[17:37] [0mnewb Kent [android/36]: >30*[0m
[17:37] [0mnewb Gaidin [gentech/133]: The limit isn't because of hardcore, it's because of Androids (and other core guilds have the same one)[0m
[17:38] [0mnewb Jeraud [android/61]: Also: you can only raise 60 component levels total. (from info upgrade)[0m
[17:39] [0mnewb Whoknows [priest/133]: my bad, thought mskill bonus was limited[0m
[17:40] [0mnewb Kent [android/36]: my b was responding to 'whoknows'[0m
