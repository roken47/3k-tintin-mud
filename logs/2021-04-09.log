[14:05] [0m[31;1m[Clan] Elektra :[0m i believe ac formula is damage = damage - rand(0,ac)[0m
[14:06] [0m[31;1m[Clan] Nameless :[0m ahhh so sorta similar process[0m
[14:06] [0m[31;1m[Clan] Elektra :[0m so max AC is 991 in a slot... so if you had 1000 say (to make math easier), on[0m

[14:06] [0m[31;1m[Clan] Boscar :[0m ac at a certain # = immunity[0m
[14:06] [0m[31;1m[Clan] Elektra :[0m because there is also a min ac[0m
[14:06] [0m[31;1m[Clan] Nameless :[0m and dr is roughly a fractional multiplier probably on that incoming number[0m

[14:07] [0m[31;1m[Clan] Elektra :[0m so i think min ac is like 1/10th regular ac[0m
[14:07] [0m[31;1m[Clan] Elektra :[0m so instead of half it might be 0.55[0m
