[02:00] [0m<BS> Zokko : its criticsl. so regen or sp heals[0m
[02:00] [0m<BS> Xiu : yeah, the only thing a weapon can do for us other than SP healing[0m
[02:00] [0m           is if it has a true extra attack, altho that only helps much much[0m

[02:02] [0m           from glevel bonsues so when you're big it's some dmg[0m
[02:02] [0m<BS> Celes : nod, but if I'm not tanking, maybe 1-2 dps weapon dedications[0m
[02:02] [0m             are worthwhile?[0m
[02:03] [0m<BS> Xiu : keeping in mind also that maxing a weapon is a long term deal.[0m
[02:03] [0m           assuming you use nothing but one weapon from glevel 15 on it's[0m
[02:03] [0m           reasonable to max it at maybe glevel 70 or so. depending on how[0m
[02:03] [0m           much you do skills vs glevels of course[0m
[02:03] [0m<BS> Celes : nod. good to know[0m
[02:05] [0m<BS> Xiu : but if you don't feel like getting something with SP healing (too[0m
[02:05] [0m           much trouble) then my advice becomes dedicate something you can[0m
[02:05] [0m           easily get that you just think is cool.[0m
[02:05] [0m<BS> Zokko : that's what I did[0m

[02:05] [0m             isnt hard[0m
[02:06] [0m<BS> Zokko : even spork I hear is great healing[0m
[02:06] [0m<BS> Xiu : remember about what glevel you were when you hit legendary?[0m
[02:07] [0m<BS> Zokko : I was about 85[0m
[02:07] [0m<BS> Xiu nods[0m
[02:07] [0m<BS> Zokko : but I also spent a tom of time on skills on the road to 65[0m
[02:08] [0m<BS> Zokko : valyns maul would be awesome if it wasnt 2h[0m
[02:09] [0m<BS> Zokko : thereafter lot of gear that can cover the difference too[0m
[02:10] [0m<BS> Zokko : pfp, greenstone amulet,crels rings[0m
[02:10] [0m<BS> Xiu : before glevel 25 it'll probably seem that SP heals are wasted[0m
[02:10] [0m           because your regen caps will be 20/14 sp/so'kra so you'll be[0m
[02:10] [0m           running out of so'kra with plenty of SP left. but once you get[0m
[02:10] [0m           spiritweave (gl25) you can start turning excess SP into so'kra.[0m
[02:22] [0m<BS> Xiu : it's also worth noting that the weapon related mskills don't[0m
[02:22] [0m           effect us. or it may be more accurate to say that since WC is[0m
[02:22] [0m           such a small part of the dmg formula (and thank heavens for that)[0m
[02:22] [0m           boosting your final WC with those isn't worth much.[0m
[02:24] [0m<BS> Celes : also good to know[0m

[02:38] [0m             do affect dmg output though[0m
