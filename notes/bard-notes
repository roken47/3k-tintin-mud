Con for HP obviously
Dex for Dodge purposes
Wis/Str little effect on Damage
Cha to 100 for karma or more cha for larger karma Pool
Int to 10.

Bards: Mystic and Gallant don't need Int, 10 or less is fine.
Gallant less of a tank 

Nix: but wis/str have negligble effects on dmg, cha you can get by with 100, more
doesn't do anything but increase your karma pool, and int if your mystic you can
leave at 10 or less and your fine, if your a gallant well talk to byroin
